There are a few cases when manually installing a WordPress Plugin is appropriate.

* If your server does not permit automatic installation of a WordPress Plugin.
* If you want to try the [latest development version](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-ostatus).

Installation of a WordPress Plugin manually requires FTP familiarity and the awareness that you may put your site at risk if you install a WordPress Plugin incompatible with the current version or from an unreliable source.

Backup your site completely before proceeding.

To install a WordPress Plugin manually:

* Download your WordPress Plugin to your desktop.
    * Download from [the WordPress directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ostatus/)
    * Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-ostatus/releases)
* If downloaded as a zip archive, extract the Plugin folder to your desktop.
* With your FTP program, upload the Plugin folder to the `wp-content/plugins` folder in your WordPress directory online.
* Go to [Plugins screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens#Plugins) and find the newly uploaded Plugin in the list.
* Click **Activate** to activate it.
